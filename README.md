# Salesforce to Database - Account Migration.


## Integration Use Case 

This integration template helps to migrate Salesforce Accounts to a Database. Initially all the existing accounts will be migrated using a batch job. After that a lisstner listens to the updates on Salesforce Accounts and publishes the updated accounts to the database.

## Prerequisites

- [Ballerina Distribution](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/)
- A Text Editor or an IDE ([VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ballerina.ballerina), 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina)).  
- [Salesforce Connector](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-sfdc) will be downloaded from 
[Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/) when running the Ballerina file.

## Confuguring source and target APIs/systems

Let's first see how to add the Salesforce configurations for the application.

#### Setup Salesforce configurations
Create a Salesforce account and create a connected app by visiting [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com). 
Obtain the following parameters:

* Base URL (Endpoint)
* Client Id
* Client Secret
* Access Token
* Refresh Token
* Refresh URL

For more information on obtaining OAuth2 credentials, visit 
[Salesforce help documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate_overview.htm) 
or follow the 
[Setup tutorial](https://medium.com/@bpmmendis94/obtain-access-refresh-tokens-from-salesforce-rest-api-a324fe4ccd9b).

Also, keep a note of your Salesforce username, password and the security token that will be needed for initializing the listener. 

For more information on the secret token, please visit [Reset Your Security Token](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=user_security_token.htm&type=5).

#### Create push topic in Salesforce developer console

The Salesforce trigger requires topics to be created for each event. We need to configure a topic as we listen on Account entity.

1. From the Salesforce UI, select developer console. Go to debug > Open Execute Anonymous Window. 
2. Paste following apex code to create 'AccountUpdate' topic
```apex
PushTopic pushTopic = new PushTopic();
pushTopic.Name = 'AccountUpdate';
pushTopic.Query = 'SELECT Id, Name, Type, Phone, Fax, AccountNumber, Website, Industry, Ownership FROM Account';
pushTopic.ApiVersion = 48.0;
pushTopic.NotifyForOperationUpdate = true;
pushTopic.NotifyForFields = 'Referenced';
insert pushTopic;
```

3. Once the creation is done, specify the topic name in event listener service config.

## Confuring the Integration Template

Once you obtained all configurations, Replace "" in the `ballerina.conf` file with your data.

##### ballerina.conf
```
SF_EP_URL=""
SF_ACCESS_TOKEN=""
SF_CLIENT_ID="" 
SF_CLIENT_SECRET=""
SF_REFRESH_TOKEN=""
SF_REFRESH_URL=""

SF_USERNAME=""
SF_PASSWORD=""
SF_ACCOUNT_TOPIC=""

DB_USER=""
DB_PWD=""

```

#### Setup Database
1. The account updates are added to a database and this template uses MySQL as the RDBMS. 
2. You can create the required database and the tables using [accounts.sql](./accounts.sql) script. 
3. Based on the use case that you implement, you can change the database schema and the content that you wish to add to the database. 


## Running the Template

1. First you need to build the integration template and create the executable binary. Run the following command from the root directory of the integration template. 
`$ ballerina build -a`. 

2. Then you can run the integration binary with the following command. 
`$ java -jar target/bin/sfdcaccmigration.jar`. 

Initially all the existing accounts will be migrated to database.
After that successful listener startup will print following in the console.
```
>>>>
[2020-11-19 01:26:43.322] Success:[/meta/handshake]
{ext={replay=true, payload.format=true}, minimumVersion=1.0, clientId=8no3ahcyo75wdk1xqzxgahp4i5n, supportedConnectionTypes=[Ljava.lang.Object;@52f6690d, channel=/meta/handshake, id=1, version=1.0, successful=true}
<<<<
>>>>
[2020-11-19 01:26:43.562] Success:[/meta/connect]
{clientId=8no3ahcyo75wdk1xqzxgahp4i5n, advice={reconnect=retry, interval=0, timeout=110000}, channel=/meta/connect, id=2, successful=true}
<<<<
```

3. Now you can update an existing Salesforce Account and observe that integration template runtime has received the event notification for the updated Salesforce Account.

4. Also you can check the Account table of the database to verify that the updated Account is added to the table.
